## Trading Rewards

Traders on 0xMarkets earn **10% of total subnet ALPHA emissions** distributed each epoch through:

### Weekly Leaderboards

* **Trade to earn**: Your trading volume and activity generate points
* **Weekly epochs**: Rewards calculated Friday 00:00 UTC → Thursday 23:59 UTC
* **Emission share**: Points convert to ALPHA rewards from the 10% trader allocation
* **Track rewards**: View your accumulated rewards at [cartha.finance/leaderboard](https://cartha.finance/leaderboard)

### Introducing Broker (IB) Program

* **Refer traders**: Earn rebates on referred trading volume
* **Program-specific formula**: Custom reward structures for qualified IBs
* **Part of 10% allocation**: IB rebates come from the same 10% trader emission pool

### How Rewards Work

Trader rewards are accumulated in a multisig wallet and swept to trader wallets via the liquidity flow controller. You can view the current reward pool and your position on the leaderboard page.

**In return**, miners benefit from **50% of trading fees** you generate, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where:
- Traders get ALPHA emissions + leverage trading
- Miners get trading fees + ALPHA emissions

> Risk: Perpetual futures and leverage are high‑risk products. See [Legal & risk](../legal-and-risk.md).
