# Traders

* Permissionless onboarding; fixed trading fee.&#x20;
* Leverage: **up to 500x** on FX, commodities, and other RWAs.
* **Earn from incentive pool** through weekly leaderboard rewards and IB rebates.

## Trading Rewards

Traders on 0xMarkets can earn from the **incentive pool** (10% of total subnet ALPHA emissions) distributed each epoch through:

### Weekly Leaderboards

* **Trade to earn**: Your trading volume and activity generate points
* **Weekly epochs**: Rewards calculated Friday 00:00 UTC → Thursday 23:59 UTC
* **Emission share**: Points convert to ALPHA rewards from the incentive pool allocation
* **Track rewards**: View your accumulated rewards at [cartha.finance/leaderboard](https://cartha.finance/leaderboard)

### Introducing Broker (IB) Program

* **Refer traders**: Earn rebates on referred trading volume
* **Program-specific formula**: Custom reward structures for qualified IBs
* **Part of 10% allocation**: IB rebates come from the same 10% incentive pool

### How Rewards Work

Rewards from the incentive pool are accumulated in a multisig wallet and swept to participant wallets via the liquidity flow controller. You can view the current incentive pool and your position on the leaderboard page.

**In return**, miners benefit from **50% of trading fees** you generate, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where:
- Traders get incentive pool rewards + leverage trading
- Miners get trading fees + ALPHA emissions
