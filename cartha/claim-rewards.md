1. Go to [cartha.finance/principal-miners](https://cartha.finance/principal-miners) and pick your principal miner (e.g. **General Tensor**)
2. **Connect your EVM wallet** — the one you used to lock your USDC
3. Scroll to your earnings summary and click the green **"Claim Rewards"** button
4. Enter the amount (or click **MAX**) and paste your **Bittensor coldkey** (SS58 address)
5. Click **"Sign & Claim"** and sign the message in your wallet
6. Done — your ALPHA is sent to your Bittensor coldkey

## Prerequisites

- **Bittensor coldkey** — SS58 address where ALPHA will be sent

### Don't have a Bittensor wallet?

- **Talisman** (browser extension): [talisman.xyz](https://www.talisman.xyz/) — create a wallet, add Bittensor account, copy your coldkey SS58
- **CLI**: `btcli wallet create` — see [Bittensor docs](https://docs.learnbittensor.org/btcli)
