## 0xMarkets — FX Perp DEX, secured by Cartha (SN35)

**What it is:** A Multi-asset (FX, Crypto and Commodities) Perpetual Futures DEX where traders can get exposure with high leverage, while liquidity is sourced from the Cartha Subnet (SN35) — miners act as LPs through USDC vaults (one per market) for risk isolation.

**Why it matters**

* Deep, programmatic liquidity from miners (LPs) on Cartha SN35.
* Simple economics: trading fees flow to LPs and the treasury; liquidations reinforce safety.
* Governance directs emissions and tunes parameters via veALPHA.
