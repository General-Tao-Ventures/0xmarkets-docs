# How it works

**People → Epochs → Market → Safety → Governance**

* **Miners** deposit USDC into market‑specific vaults; their liquidity powers trading.
* **[Weekly Epochs](weekly-epochs.md)**: Rewards are calculated on a weekly cycle (Friday 00:00 UTC → Thursday 23:59 UTC). Lock by Thursday 23:00 UTC to give the indexer time to detect your position.
* **Traders** trade perps (up to **500x**) in a permissionless way; pay a fixed trading fee.
* **Safety**: multi‑oracle prices with validator cross‑checks; liquidations and an insurance pool.
* **Governance**: veALPHA directs emissions and tunes fees/parameters.
