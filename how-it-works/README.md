# How it works

**People → Market → Safety → Governance**

* **Miners** deposit USDC into market‑specific vaults; their liquidity powers trading.
* **Traders** trade perps (up to **500x**) in a permissionless way; pay a fixed trading fee.
* **Safety**: multi‑oracle prices with validator cross‑checks; liquidations and an insurance pool.
* **Governance**: veALPHA directs emissions and tunes fees/parameters.
