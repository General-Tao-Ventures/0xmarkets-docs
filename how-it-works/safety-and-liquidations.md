# Safety & liquidations

### Pricing and monitoring

* Multiple oracle providers; validators cross‑verify; fallback oracles for reliability.&#x20;

### Liquidation lifecycle

* Trigger: margin breach → position liquidated → **10% liquidation fee**, split:\
  **20% validators / 50% insurance pool / 30% ALPHA buyback & burn**.&#x20;
* Insurance pool is governance‑controlled and backstops gaps/black swans.&#x20;
